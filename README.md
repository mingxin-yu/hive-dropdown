This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Possible improvement for this project:

1. I didn't implement any hover effects, but I can add them if requested.
2. If the options input is too long (e.g., 100 or more options), it would be beneficial to implement lazy loading and search functionality for the list section.
